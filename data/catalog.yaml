      "What Lies in the Path of the Revolution"
    year: 2018
    location: https://tcher.tech/publications/PPIG2018_WhatLiesInThePathOfTheRevolution.pdf
    quotes:
      - "Many of the technological barriers to ownership, especially as regards
        software, can be seen as embedded in certain questions of “reuse” — one
        of the central affordances of ownership is the ability to transplant a
        thing from its original location to a different one, following the
        desires or person of the owner. For most kinds of software this is
        possible in only a crude way — an “application” can be installed on one
        machine rather than another — and with the rising prevalence of rental
        or cloud-based models for the deployment of software, it is decreasingly
        possible at all."
      - "If you find a piece of software that does something of value to you,
        **it should be possible to make it your own**. This implies that you can
        keep using it as part of the collection of tools you carry with you, in
        familiar contexts, or experiment with using it in novel contexts."

      "The mythical matched modules: overcoming the tyranny of inflexible
      software construction"
    year: 2009
    location: https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/srk21/research/papers/kell09mythical.pdf
    quotes:
      - "Conventional tools yield expensive and inﬂexible software. ... I propose
        that a solution must radically separate the concern of integration in
        software: ﬁrstly by using novel tools specialised towards integration
        (the “**integration domain**”), and secondly by prohibiting use of
        preexisting interfaces (“interface hiding”) outside that domain."
      - "Placing high-level tool support for integration and adaptation close to
        the user, for example within web application mashup platforms and
        browser extensions has already led to added-value innovations which
        could not have been anticipated by the creators of the underlying
        software."

    description:
      "Meta-level run-time services for Unix processes... a.k.a. dragging Unix
      into the 1980s"
    quotes:
      - "Unix abstractions are fairly simple and fairly general, but they are
        not humane, and they invite fragmentation. By 'not humane', I mean that
        they are error-prone and difficult to experiment with interactively. By
        'fragmentation', I mean they invite building higher-level abstractions
        in mutually opaque and incompatible ways (think language VMs, file
        formats, middlewares...). To avoid these, liballocs is a minimal
        extension of Unix-like abstractions broadly in the spirit of
        Smalltalk-style dynamism, designed to counter both of these problems."
