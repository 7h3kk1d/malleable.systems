    year: 2019
    location: https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html
    quotes:
      - "Among major software platforms today, browser extensions are the rare
        exception that allow and encourage users to modify the apps that we use,
        in creative ways not intended by their original developers. On
        smartphone and desktop platforms, this sort of behavior ranges from
        unusual to impossible, but in the browser it’s an everyday activity."
      - "Since the beginning of personal computing, there’s been a philosophical
        tradition that encourages using computers as an interactive medium where
        people contribute their own ideas and build their own tools—authorship
        over consumption."

      "End-user programming"
    year: 2019
    location: https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html
    quotes:
      - "Desktop programs, web apps, and smartphone apps are to various degrees
        like appliances with a hermetic seal to keep users out of their
        interior. If there is not already a button for a given function, the
        only option for users is to petition the developer."
      - "There shouldn’t be a chasm that the user has to cross in order to
        customize the behavior of their software. Going from using to inspecting
        to modifying the system should be a gradual process where each of
        the steps is small enough to be easily discoverable. The user should not
        need to switch to “programmer mindset” but instead stay within the
        context of the application. They can stay close to their work and their
        ideas."

    description:
      "Meta-level run-time services for Unix processes... a.k.a. dragging Unix
      into the 1980s"
    quotes:
      - "Unix abstractions are fairly simple and fairly general, but they are
        not humane, and they invite fragmentation. By 'not humane', I mean that
        they are error-prone and difficult to experiment with interactively. By
        'fragmentation', I mean they invite building higher-level abstractions
        in mutually opaque and incompatible ways (think language VMs, file
        formats, middlewares...). To avoid these, liballocs is a minimal
        extension of Unix-like abstractions broadly in the spirit of
        Smalltalk-style dynamism, designed to counter both of these problems."

      software construction"
    year: 2009
    location: https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/srk21/research/papers/kell09mythical.pdf
    quotes:
      - "Conventional tools yield expensive and inﬂexible software. ... I propose
        that a solution must radically separate the concern of integration in
        software: ﬁrstly by using novel tools specialised towards integration
        (the “**integration domain**”), and secondly by prohibiting use of
        preexisting interfaces (“interface hiding”) outside that domain."
      - "Placing high-level tool support for integration and adaptation close to
        the user, for example within web application mashup platforms and
        browser extensions has already led to added-value innovations which
        could not have been anticipated by the creators of the underlying
        software."

      Software as a “place”
    year: 2019
    location: https://twitter.com/yoshikischmitz/status/1208625526966902784
    quotes:
      - "What makes a piece of software a “place” vs a “tool” or an “appliance”?
        ... I think some notion of **limitlessness and nesting** are necessary.
        [The feeling of a “place”] seems to come from some kind of
        limitlessness: Notion has infinite hierarchies, Figma has an infinite
        canvas. ... This definition matters to me because appliances are static,
        but places can be occupied and changed. You can have memories and
        experiences in them. Things can grow in them. New stuff can emerge.
        Communities can form. I want more software to be like that."

    title:
      "What Lies in the Path of the Revolution"
    year: 2018
    location: https://tcher.tech/publications/PPIG2018_WhatLiesInThePathOfTheRevolution.pdf
    quotes:
      - "We argue that a form of “**digital serfdom**” has rapidly grown up around
        us, where various important classes of artefacts, increasingly essential
        for everyday life, including participation in political and economic
        life, cannot be effectively owned by ordinary individuals."
      - "Many of the technological barriers to ownership, especially as regards
        software, can be seen as embedded in certain questions of “reuse” — one
        of the central affordances of ownership is the ability to transplant a
        thing from its original location to a different one, following the
        desires or person of the owner. For most kinds of software this is
        possible in only a crude way — an “application” can be installed on one
        machine rather than another — and with the rising prevalence of rental
        or cloud-based models for the deployment of software, it is decreasingly
        possible at all."
      - "If you find a piece of software that does something of value to you,
        **it should be possible to make it your own**. This implies that you can
        keep using it as part of the collection of tools you carry with you, in
        familiar contexts, or experiment with using it in novel contexts."

      "Our conception of “computing” has changed and continues to change. This

    image: /works/space.png
    quotes:
      - "Currently, only those who have a programming background or resources
        have the ability to create digital artifacts. This forces the rest of
        the world to be consumers, rather than creators or authors. When
        creating digital products, our conception of target audience is “users.”
        The notion of “users” sometimes assumes that their main goal is
        consuming instead of playing, creating, or conversing. What if the
        digital environment was inclusive enough for anyone to create? How can
        we provide the tools that will enable everyone to become authors?"

    image: /works/webstrates.png
    quotes:
      - "Webstrates offer a novel approach for creating shareable dynamic media
        that blur the distinction between documents and applications. Our vision
        requires software to be malleable by users, so they can appropriate
        documents and tools to meet individual needs; shareable among users, so
        they can collaborate on multiple aspects of the media; and distributable
        across heterogeneous devices and platforms."
      - "By sharing embedded code, behavior typically associated with
        application software can also be (collaboratively) manipulated, opening
        the way to novel possibilities for combining content, computation and
        interaction. Webstrates can be composed by embedding one webstrate
        within another, a process called transclusion, that lets users
        truly share, rather than copy, content."
