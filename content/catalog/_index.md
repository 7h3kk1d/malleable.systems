This catalog highlights projects, people, groups, research, and other
initiatives in the malleable software community. It is our hope that bringing
more awareness to these efforts will lead to greater collaboration and better
systems for us all that support the [essential principles]({{< relref
"../_index.md">}}) of malleability.

If you know of people or projects that should be added, please
[contribute](https://github.com/malleable-systems/malleable.systems) or [send us
a note](mailto:feedback@malleable.systems). Similarly, please let us know about
anything that should be removed or corrected.

_Order in the catalog is randomised on each page load._
